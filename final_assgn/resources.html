			<p class="main-text"> Zines (often shorted from Magazine or Fanzine) are a form of hand-made, (sometimes!) small-batch art form. Zines are generally understood to be miniature magazines that are self-published works of original artwork and texts arranged into small booklets. Zines have a history in the usage of political and social movements as ways for communities and subcultures generally based of marginalized individuals to share ideas, express themselves and thoughts, and provide space for one another. </p>

			<p class="main-text"> Usually reproduced through copy machine, many artists have begun to use Risograph printers for Zine making and distribution. Because it is cheaper to utilize a Riso printer for large batches, they are an extremely popular use medium for Zine makers to share their work. Risograph printing and Zines are usually tied together, with many Zine artists utilizing the printers and sharing them with their communities. For this purpose, Zines and Riso are intrinsically tied together both historically and culturally.</p>
