			<h1 id="page-title">The History of the Risograph!</h1>

			<p class="main-text"> The Risograph printer was invented by <span class="highlight">Noboru Hayama</span> at the Riso Kagaku Corporation in 1958. 
				Post WWII, only certain types of expensive emulsion inks were available in Japan, making printing difficult and expensive. 
				<span class="highlight">Seeking to find a more cost-effective printing method, with the same caliber (or higher!) quality, the Risograph was born.</span></p>

			<p class="main-text"> The Risograph, similar to the Mimeograph — a duplicating machine that produces paper copies from a stencil — are soy-based ink digital duplicators specifically designed for medium to high volume printing.
				It operates similarly to screen printing and offers a silkscreen-esque texture spot color inks. 
				<span class="highlight"> By 1986, the Risograph had spread to West and it made short-run printing for community oriented spaces like churches, schools, 
				small businesses, much easier.</span>Duplicates between 50 and 10,000 copies were a perfect fit for the machine. 
				While photocopiers replaced the need for Risographs, they’ve become a valuable, yet niche, tool for artists who find them perfect for creating and sharing prints, 
				with their naturally variable and imperfect quality (due to each single piece of paper passing multiple times through the machine) becoming apart of its charm and why so many love the medium. </p>

			 <h1 id="page-title">Risograph today & Craft Culture</h1>	
			<p class="main-text"> Despite its lack of popularity in modern-day office spaces, the Risograph is a much beloved tool for artists. 
				The Risograph has become a widely beloved tool for artists, giving it a resurgence in popularity for those interested in self-publishing. 
				Risograph machines allow for low-cost, colorful spot color palettes, and are a specific mixture of digital and analog art processes — giving artists who use it, a special and unique quality to their work. Many independent publishing houses such as <a href="https://www.txtbooks.us/">TXTBooks</a>, <a href="https://www.peow.studio/shop">PEOW Studios </a>, and <a href="https://genderfailpress.info/">GENDERFAIL</a>, have helped the Risograph regain its traction, 
				coinciding with a large interest in Riso world-wide. </p> 

			<p class="main-text"> The widespread love of Risograph printers can also be seen through the <a href="https://www.stencil.wiki/atlas">Atlas of Modern Risography</a> -- an interactive map showcasing independent Print Houses, makers, and artists, world-wide who utilize it in their operations and work.</p>
