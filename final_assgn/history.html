			<h1 id="page-title">The History of the Risograph!</h1>

			<p class="main-text"> The Risograph printer was invented by Noboru Hayama at the Riso Kagaku Corporation in 1958. 
				Post WWII, only certain types of expensive emulsion inks were available in Japan, making printing difficult and expensive. 
				Seeking to find a more cost-effective printing method, with the same caliber (or higher!) quality, the Risograph was born.</p>

				<p class="main-text"> The Risograph, similar to the Mimeograph — a duplicating machine that produces paper copies from a stencil — are soy-based ink digital duplicators specifically designed for medium to high volume printing.
					It operates similarly to screen printing and offers a silkscreen-esque texture spot color inks. 
					By 1986, the Risograph had spread to West and it made short-run printing for community oriented spaces like churches, schools, 
					small businesses, incredibly easier. Duplicates between 50 and 10,000 copies were a perfect fit for the machine. 
					While photocopiers replaced the need for Risographs, they’ve become a valuable, yet niche, tool for artists who find them perfect for creating and sharing prints, 
					with their naturally variable and imperfect quality (due to each single piece of paper passing multiple times through the machine) becoming apart of its charm and why so many love the medium. </p>
